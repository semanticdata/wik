# wik

*A ridiculously simple personal wiki.*

Originally implemented in a single 160-line HTML file, now broken into multiple files to make it easier to learn and maintain.

Try it now: <a href="https://semanticdata.github.io/wik/">semanticdata.github.io/wik</a>

> Bookmark it - it will keep working when you're offline.

## Goals

* Be really, really simple.
* Save all data in browser localstorage
* No separate 'edit mode' like most wikis. Pages are directly editable.
* Work equally well on mobile and desktop.
* Support browser navigation (back/forward/bookmark etc)
* Store all data locally on device.
* Decent keyboard navigation.
* Work offline.

## Changes from Upstream

* Break up into individual HTML, CSS, and JS files
* Deploy new [demo site]([https://](https://semanticdata.github.io/wik/))
* Add MIT License
